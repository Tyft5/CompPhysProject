/*
    This is the driver class that will be doing all the stuff.
    Make sure this file and Ball.java are always in the same folder, or shit will get ugly.

    Standard coding practice is to split stuff you want to do up into logical functional groupings and code each functionality into a method. The main() method is what is run when the code is called, and it should be fairly abstract, essentially (if your methods are named well) outlining what will happen. This makes debugging way easier and makes the code look nicer overall. Put your methods before main() and make them static (anything in the class but not in a method needs to be static).

    Constructor for a ball: Ball(double position, double mass, double radius, double velocity)
        Needs at minimum a position.

    OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS
    - How do we want to initialize constants? Terminal input, just typing them in the code, etc? Eventually some sort of input would be nice for testing different parameters.

    TO DO
    - Method to move balls. Maybe multiple with different conditions for different end goals (height, speed, etc)?
    - Method to calculate energy(s)
    - User interface
    - Develop consistent theory of quantum love
